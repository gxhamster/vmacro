This does not implement the movements and actions 
exactly like vim
Creating a program that could process a vim macro
and execute that macro on each line on a file

-- Tasks --
* Multihreading (Not important)
* Optimzing process_line
* Add change command (Eg: cw)
  Will delete word and insert

-- Progress -- 

-- Done --
* Inserting characters at cursor 
* Searching in the line
* Accepting input from stdin (true unix tool)
