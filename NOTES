This does not implement the movements and actions 
exactly like vim
Creating a program that could process a vim macro
and execute that macro on each line on a file

-- Things to do --

- Identify words (DONE)
- Commands: d (DONE)

TODO: Add extra vim commands
f -> find (DONE)
t -> till
0 -> start of line
^ -> start of first word
$ -> end of line
F -> search backward
T -> till backward

- Also able to insert characters

TODO: Seperate things (Done)

- FIXME: Deleting a lot of characters individually is very slow (Eg: 40dh)
